This was some initial curve testing for reading curves. It also has some limited ability to write curves, but I think this may be useless since it turns out all the curve data is directly baked into the CurveAtlas which references the curve. CurveAtlas editing is not supported by UAssetAPI, so you need to write to the bytes directly. Luckily they have a straightforward format where each subsequent pixel is simply stored as RGBA floats. However I haven't implemented anything here yet; so far I've been recreating the Curves/CurveAtlases in Unreal Engine to edit them.
