This is just some super incomplete testing for attempting to edit MasterMaterials. Unfortunately they are not supported by UAssetAPI, so I tried to use Cue4Parse (what FModel uses) since I know it can parse MM data, but I wasn't able to figure out how to actually use that to edit it. But furthermore, I'm not even sure whether or not MM parameters actually do need to be changed ever. So further research into this will remain as a last resort option.
